# Final Project: Why & how to choose a Porsche 911?
## Outline
### Summary
When we talk about exotic sports cars, what comes to your mind first? Is that a Lamboghini or Ferrari? There are many classic cars highly praised by auto fans around the world, but there is one name that stamps in peoples' mind - Porsche 911. In this project, I will spark your interest by going over the history of 911 and, more importantly, show you how to select your own Porsche 911.  

### Project Structure
Why Porsche 911 is a Great choice?   
In this section, I will go over a variety of aspects and show why 911 is a great choice in terms of commute and fun. Also, I will mention Porsche 911 is one of the best choice to get joy with relatively low cost. To push a little bit further, a sales data is displayed to show Porsche is losing money on researching 911 and tring its best to keep the legend alive.

Revolution of Porsche 911
2023 is the 60th aniversary of Porsche 911. I will go over how 911 evolved in its 8 different generations. A brief comparison will be given to show how each generation looks like and how it performs. 

Current Porsche 911 Models
This part talks about all available 911 models in US market right now. I will talk about the major differences between each model, including performance, appearances, and prices. Finally, a recommendation will be given as all CMU graduate students are potential buyers.
