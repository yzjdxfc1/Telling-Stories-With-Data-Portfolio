# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU in Spring 2024.

# About me
Name: Fan Chen  
School: Carnegie Mellon University  
Program: Master Of Information System Management (MISM)  
LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/aomacb-cfan/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aomacb-cfan/)  

Following my graduation from Ohio State University in 2017, I embarked on a career in the tech industry, working with various companies over the next five years. However, the pandemic significantly altered my worldview, especially the meaning of my life, sparking a newfound interest in entrepreneurship. In pursuit of this passion, I enrolled at Carnegie Mellon University in 2023 to acquire the comprehensive skill set necessary to realize my entrepreneurial dreams

# What I hope to learn
Why do I take this course? The answer is clear: **To be able to tell strories with data.**  
As a future entrepreneur, the ability to present data is vital. My audience will not only be colleagues I work with but also venture capital investors who are interested in my business. Knowing how to present data in an organized and appealing way will become my key to success.   

There are a few broad topics I am interested:
- extraction & highlight: know which part of data is more important and needs to be highlighted
- color: pick the right color for text and graphs
- graphs: demonstrate content by using support graphs
- story telling: form compelling stories or statements along with data
